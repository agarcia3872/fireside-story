             It was a dark and stormy night....
            Most of the city had fled due to the evacuation order, but me and sparky stayed to try to weather the storm..
            Hopefully the shutters would hold. I decided to try and sleep through it and was starting to go to sleep when suddenly, I heard a loud crack...
            It was a tree branch outside my bedroom window. It cracked from the force of the winds. It was dangling from the tree, barely hanging on.
             Hours passed and I somehow got better used to sounds and occasional flashes that came from the windows. Fatigued 
            finally overcame me and I gradually dozed off to sleep. I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
