            A Stormy Night

              It was a dark and stormy night....
            Most of the city had fled due to the evacuation order, but me and sparky
            stayed to try to weather the storm. Hopefully the shutters would hold. 
            I decided to try and sleep through it and was starting to go to sleep when 
            suddenly, I heard a loud crack...
              It was a tree branch outside my bedroom window. It cracked from the force
            of the winds. It was dangling from the tree, barely hanging on.
            Hours passed and I somehow got better used to sounds and occasional flashes
            that came from the windows. Fatigue finally overcame me and I gradually dozed
            off to sleep. I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
              After a long stormy night without much sleep, I joyfully welcomed the new day. 
            We made it to see a new day with a beautiful sunrise and sounds of singing birds.
